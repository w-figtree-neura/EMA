1) EyeSeeCam - Changed execution of load script to be more efficient.
2) EyeSeeCam - Restored the ability to simply load whatever eye pos/vel data is in a recorded file as per older versions of EMA
3) EyeSeeCam - Removed autopopulation of calibration files. It was confusing and often incorrect or simply failed.
4) EyeSeeCam - Removed the need to manually specify a detection threshold for head pitch/roll axes alignment. The threshold is now calculated at the 75th percentile.
5) EyeSeeCam - Improved the Settings tab GUI to reflect the changes in this update.
6) EyeSeeCam - Script no longer uses the MATLAB rotz() function which was causing distribution problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) EyeSeeCam Plugin - Made the 'Idle' state occur on timeout rather than having to explicitly request it
2) EyeSeeCam Plugin - Included a Head Calibration File to align Pitch/Roll Axes in LARP/RALP tests
3) EyeSeeCam Plugin - Renamed impulse test types 'YAW' and 'YAW / LARP / RALP'
